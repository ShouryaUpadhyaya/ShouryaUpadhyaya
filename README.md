Hi there, I'm Shouray! ðŸ‘‹
My Journey into Computer Science ðŸš€
My interest in computer science sparked in seventh grade when I took a robotics class. That class opened up a whole new world for meâ€”programming and robotics were like discovering a universe of endless possibilities. I was hooked. It wasnâ€™t long before I began learning Python and C++, eager to create something meaningful.

Building My Foundations
In ninth grade, I spent my summer knee-deep in Python, tinkering with Arduino projects. I started with small things like LED displays and simple games, but soon I found myself exploring more complex componentsâ€”breadboards, sensors, you name it. My projects began evolving: a miniature boat, a remote-controlled car, a radar, and even a game controller.

These projects weren't just fun to build, they taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving and persistence. When I showcased my work at my school's science exhibition, the recognition I received made me realise how deeply passionate I was about both robotics and programming.

Expanding Horizons: Web Development
At the same time, I was becoming curious about web development. So I dived into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It didnâ€™t take long before I realised how vast the world of computer science really was. Wanting to push my skills further, I began learning React and Tailwind during my free time. The challenges were tough, but every time I overcame a hurdle, I could feel my excitement for solving complex problems grow.

Internship and Beyond
During an internship at Design Web Technology, I was introduced to Flutter, adding app development to my skill set. This experience not only expanded my knowledge but deepened my love for computer science. The way robotics, programming, and web development all come together still fascinates me.
